This is from the 'old' README.md. I have taken it out and placed a copy here. For those who have interest reading.

## Lawsuit

```

Extenject has been removed from Asset Store because of a copyright claim by 
Modest Tree, so the only way to obtain it currently is through the 
https://github.com/svermeulen/Extenject/releases.

Modest Tree has also blocked me from contributing to zenject github issues and 
removed me from the zenject gitter chat, so to get my help please report 
issues https://github.com/svermeulen/Extenject/issues/new, 
and discuss in the https://gitter.im/Extenject/community instead

They have also filed a lawsuit against me and Unity tells me that they will 
not re-enable Extenject in the Asset Store until the lawsuit is complete, 
which might not occur until 2020.

I have been advised not to comment on details of the lawsuit right now 
however you can read their filing and my defense (both of which are public) 
for details if interested.  The lawsuit also relates to other MIT licensed 
open source projects I created such as Projeny and Unity3dAsyncAwaitUtil.
