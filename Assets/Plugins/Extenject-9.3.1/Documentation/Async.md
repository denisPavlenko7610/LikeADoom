## Introduction
### Async in DI

In dependency injection, the injector resolves dependencies of the target class only once, often after class is first created. In other words, injection is a one time process that does not track the injected dependencies to update them later on. If a dependency is not ready at the moment of injection, either the binding wouldn't resolve in case of optional bindings or would fail completely throwing an error.

This creates a dilemma while implementing dependencies that are resolved asynchronous. You can design around the DI limitations by carefully designing your code so that the injection happens after the `async` process is completed. This requires careful planning, which leads to an increased complexity in the setup, and is also prone to errors.

Alternatively you can inject an intermediary object that tracks the result of the `async` operation. When you need to access the dependency, you can use this intermediary object to check if the `async` task is completed and get the resulting object. With the experimental `async` support, we would like to provide ways to tackle this problem in Extenject. You can find `async` extensions in the folder **Plugins/Zenject/Source/Runtime/Async**.

### Example

Lets see how we can inject async dependencies through an intermediary object. Async extensions implements `AsyncInject<T>` as this intermediary. You can use it as follows. 


```csharp
public class TestInstaller : MonoInstaller<TestInstaller>
{
    public override void InstallBindings()
    {
         Container.BindAsync<IFoo>().FromMethod(async () =>
            {
                await Task.Delay(100);
                return (IFoo) new Foo();
            }).AsCached();
    }
}

public class Bar : IInitializable, IDisposable
{
    readonly AsyncInject<IFoo> _asyncFoo;
    IFoo _foo;
    public Bar(AsyncInject<IFoo> asyncFoo)
    {
        _asyncFoo = asyncFoo;
    }

    public void Initialize()
    {
        if (!_asyncFoo.TryGetResult(out _foo))
        {
            _asyncFoo.Completed += OnFooReady;
        }
    }
       
    private void OnFooReady(IFoo foo)
    {
        _foo = foo;
    }

    public void Dispose()
    {
        _asyncFoo.Completed -= OnFooReady;
    }
}
```

Here we use `BindAsync<IFoo>().FromMethod()` to pass an `async` lambda that waits for 100 ms and then returns a newly created `Foo` instance. This method can be any other method with the signature `Task<T> Method()`. *Note: the `async` keyword is an implementation detail and thus not part of the signature. The `BindAsync<T>` extension method provides a separate binder for `async` operations. This binder is currently limited to a few `FromX()` providers. Features like Pooling and Factories are not supported at the moment.

With the above `AsyncInject<IFoo>` binding, the instance is added to the container. Since the scope is set to `AsCached()` the operation will run only once and `AsyncInject<IFoo>` will keep the result. It is important to note that `async` operations won't start before this binding is getting resolved. If you want `async` operation to start immediately after installing, use `NonLazy()` option. 

Once injected to `Bar`, we can check whether the return value of the `async` operation is already available by calling the `TryGetResult`. method. This method will return `false` if there is no result to return. If result is not ready yet, we can listen to the `Completed` event to get the return value when the `async` operation completes.

Alternatively we can use the  following methods to check the results availability.
```csharp
// Use HasResult to check if result exists 
if (_asyncFoo.HasResult)
{
    // Result will throw error if prematurely used. 
    var foo = _asyncFoo.Result;
}

// AsyncInject<T> provides custom awaiter
IFoo foo = await _asyncFoo;
```
