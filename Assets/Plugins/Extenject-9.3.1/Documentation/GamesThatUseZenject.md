Beat Saber is a virtual reality rhythm game developed and published by Beat Games. The game takes place in a surrealistic neon noir environment and features the player slicing blocks representing musical beats with a pair of contrasting colored sabers. Following an early access release in November 2018, the game was fully released for PlayStation 4 and Microsoft Windows on May 21, 2019. The game supports most virtual reality headsets, such as PlayStation VR, Oculus Quest, Oculus Rift, and Windows VR headsets supporting both Steam VR and Oculus VR APIs.

The game includes several songs with up to five levels of difficulty, starting from Easy all the way to Expert+. The player uses VR motion controllers to wield a pair of lightsabers, the left one colored red and the right one colored blue by default. In each song, the game presents the player with a stream of approaching blocks, laid out in sync with the song's beats and notes, located in one of the 12 possible positions of a 4x3 grid. The game also features the option of playing some songs in 360°, or 90° orientations where blocks approach from around the player.

Since its early access stages, the game included a single-player mode as well as a party mode, which features a leaderboard with the player's names, which are entered after each song is played. Additionally, the 1.0 release version introduced a level editor and a practice mode which allows the player to alter the song's speed, or start playing it from some point in time other than the beginning, as well as custom songs.

The game was first released in early access on Microsoft Windows on May 1, 2018. The game was released on PlayStation 4 on November 20, 2018. An editor was announced for release in May 2018, which would allow for the creation of custom user songs, but it was postponed, and added in May 2019.

In March 2019, Beat Games released its first paid song pack, featuring 10 songs from electronic music record label Monstercat. "Crab Rave" was added as a free update on April Fools' day that year. On May 2, 2019, to celebrate the game's first anniversary, a prototype version created three years prior was released to the public as Beat Saber Origins. The game was fully released out of early access on PC on May 21, 2019. On January 29, 2020, the game received a free pack featuring three songs by Japanese artist Camellia.

Facebook via Oculus Studios acquired Beat Games in November 2019. The company stated that the purchase would not affect future development of Beat Saber on third-party VR platforms besides Oculus. Beat Games will continue to operate in Prague as an independent studio, although under the umbrella of Oculus Studios. The studio released the new 360 degree levels on December 14, 2019.

Pokémon Go is a augmented reality (AR) mobile game developed and published by Niantic in collaboration with The Pokémon Company for iOS and Android devices. A part of the Pokémon franchise, the game is the result of a collaboration between Niantic, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company. It uses the mobile device GPS to locate, capture, battle, and train virtual creatures, called Pokémon, which appear as if they are in the player's real-world location. The game is free-to-play; it uses a freemium business model and supports in-app purchases for additional in-game items. The game launched with around 150 species of Pokémon, which had increased to around 600 by 2020.
<br/>
<br/>
Pokémon Go was released to mixed reviews; critics praised the concept, but criticized technical problems. It was one of the most used and profitable mobile apps in 2016, having been downloaded more than 500 million times worldwide by the end of the year. It is credited with popularizing location-based and AR technology, promoting physical activity, and helping local businesses grow due to increased foot traffic. However, it attracted controversy for contributing to accidents and creating public nuisances. Various governments expressed concerns about security, and some countries regulate its use. By early 2019, the game had over a billion global downloads and grossed over $3 billion in revenue. The game also had over 147 million monthly active users as of May 2018

Ingress (or Ingress Prime) is an augmented reality (AR) mobile game developed and published by Niantic for Android and iOS devices. The game is free-to-play, uses a freemium business model, and supports in-app purchases for additional in-game items. The mobile app has been downloaded more than 20 million times worldwide as of November 2018.
<br/>
<br/>
Ingress uses the mobile device GPS to locate and interact with "portals" which are in proximity to the player's real-world location. The portals are physical points of interest where "human creativity and ingenuity is expressed" often manifesting as public art such as statues and monuments, unique architecture, outdoor murals, historic buildings, local community hubs and other displays of human achievement. The game uses the portals as elements of a science fiction backstory along with a continuous open narrative provided through various forms of media.

Stick Soccer 2 is a soccer game where you start your own Soccer team with the name of your choice, team colors, and mascot. Once you've gotten the ball rolling on those selections, you'll have a fully fledged team capable of conquering the world of soccer facing up against today's powerhouse teams. 

Matches in Stick Soccer 2 are highly unusual in that you won't be playing the whole time. Instead, the game stops at certain key points in each event and you'll be the one to shoot game-changing goals from a myriad of different positions. In order to get the job done, you'll need to slide your finger across the screen in order to kick the ball. 

Between one match and another, you'll soon find that you'll have the chance to recruit some of the best players in the world. However, in order to access these players, you'll need to have their specific card. And we're not talking about just anyone, in this game you'll be able to play with the likes of Ronaldo, Messi, Pogba, Neymar, Iniesta and Alaba.

Stick Soccer 2 is a soccer game that'll keep you on your toes offering players a well-adapted interface designed with touch screens in mind. With awesome graphics and a huge amount of stars to draft — not to mention the nearly endless number of teams to battle — this game is fun.

Toy Clash is a tower offense game to beat up your enemy’s tower while protect yourself safe from their attacks. You are required to dominate the battlefield using your own strategy by leading your toy units and using powerful magics. At the end of the game, you will become a god of battle.

Every toy unit in Toy Clash is either stronger or weaker to a particular type of unit. So you will need to put a tanker type unit in front of long ranged units to defend their weak health points vulnerable to a melee attack. This means it is very important for player to know when and where to place units by seeing how battle is going. And the way the units are deployed will very much likely to determine your victory or defeat.

Two Dome installations were the central focus point of the Plan Jericho Stem area at the Avalon Air Show 2019. The 15m dome told the story of  Jasper, a young girl who wants to fly, and was the largest projection dome seen in Australia, made interactive through a series of touch tablets.
<br/>
<br/>
The project consisted of 2 applications developed in Unity. An Android app running on 16 Samsung tablets and a PC app running on a highly spec’ed PC, in a 15 metre dome with 8 projectors and speakers.
<br/>
<br/>
Some of the technology used for this installation included Omnity for the projection output, KlakNDI for the NDI output required by the projectionists, UNET for communication between the apps, Curvy Splines for plane paths, Post Processing Stack for visual effects. To keep things G rated Bad Word Filter PRO was used and **Zenject for gluing it all together, also taking advantage of its pooling for spawning/despawning planes**.

A music-inspired installation designed to help tennis fans better understand Yonex's role as the official string partner of the Grand Slam tournament.
Tennis fans love the game. Many who go to watch the AO also play recreationally. We tapped into their passion for the game to tell Yonex’s brand story in a way that tennis fans could relate to–through play.
<br/>
<br/>
The result was Yonex Fine Tuned–a tennis-inspired music video activation to test the precision and accuracy of fans and showcased the importance of high-quality strings. The game itself combined on-screen content with a real tennis racquet-style guitar that featured four colour-coded Yonex strings running up its neck.

NOVA Black Holes is an iPad game in which players navigate the cosmos by hurling a star at various celestial objects. Hosted by astrophysicist Janna Levin, the game is set 4 billion years in the future, when the black holes at the centers of the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies are colliding. This collision creates massive gravitational waves that send stars and planets flying in all directions. Players are given a star the size of our Sun and can control its trajectory and velocity.

In each level, the player’s task is to hurl this star at the target celestial object(s) by touching the star, pulling back on it, and adjusting a velocity vector before releasing it into space. The levels become more complicated as the game proceeds and the player must navigate increasingly challenging sets of orbital patterns and celestial objects (e.g., blue supergiant stars, neutron stars, white dwarf stars, and both stellar and supermassive black holes).

EcsRx is a reactive take on the common ECS pattern with a well separated design using rx and adhering to IoC and other sensible design patterns.
<br/><br/>
**Features:**
* Simple ECS interfaces to follow
* Fully reactive architecture
* Favours composition over inheritance
* Adheres to inversion of control
* Lightweight codebase
* Built in support for events (raise your own and react to them)
* Built in support for pooling (easy to add your own implementation or wrap 3rd party pooling tools)
* Built in support for plugins (wrap up your own components/systems/events and share them with others)
The core framework is meant to be used primarily by .Net applications/games, there is a Unity specific version [here](https://github.com/ecsrx/ecsrx.unity) which is currently being ported over to use this version.

Karma is an MVC framework for Unity3D. Because of how Unity is structured, it actually turns out to be an MVCP architecture (Model/View/Controller/Presenter) where the Presenter is a MonoBehaviour that serves as an intermediary between the Controller and the View.

It's built on top of Zenject which provides Dependency Injection (DI). DI is mainly used to route the app to the desired view, it also enables us to build composable and testable systems.

Some of the basic constructs and code layout is inspired by other MVC frameworks such as AngularJS and ASP vNext.
